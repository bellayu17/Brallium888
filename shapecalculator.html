                <br><br><p>Every person's body is unique, and so is every person's breast shape. While traditional sizing often focuses on measurements, there's another important factor when it comes to finding the right bra: shape. At Brallium, we understand that breast shape can greatly impact fit, comfort, and style preferences. 
                    That's why we've developed the <b>Breast Shape Calculator</b>—an innovative tool to help you better understand your shape and find bras that provide true comfort and support.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to bras, size is just one piece of the puzzle. Breast shape plays an equally important role in achieving a comfortable and supportive fit. Your shape can influence which bra styles will work best for you, where support is most needed, and how a bra will feel throughout the day.
